# WEEK_1-Water-Quality-Prediction-
Water Quality Prediction uses smart computer programs (AI/ML) to predict how clean or safe water will be. This helps us manage water supplies better and quickly find any pollution. The project aims to protect our environment and people's health by turning complex water information into clear, useful advice.
